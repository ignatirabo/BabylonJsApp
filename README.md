# Babylon.js project

Learning how to do videogames with `Babylon.js`.

## TODOs
There are several things I want to try before starting from scratch.
- Camera following player with smooth animations, based on the direction that
the player is looking
    - If the previous camera works, have some specific cameras for platforming?
- Add new animations to the character for jumping:
    - Animation preparing to jump
    - Animation going up
    - Animation free-falling
    - Animation landing.
- Add mechanic "loaded jump"
    - I want to have something like momentum, then when the character is running
    and starts to jump, go into "preparing to jump" animation, and slide through
    the floor while charging.
